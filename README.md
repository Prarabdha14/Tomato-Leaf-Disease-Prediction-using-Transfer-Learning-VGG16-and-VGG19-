# Tomato-Leaf-Disease-Prediction-using-Transfer-Learning-VGG16-and-VGG19-
This project aims to predict diseases in tomato leaves by leveraging the power of transfer learning with VGG16 and VGG19 pretrained models. It utilizes deep learning techniques to accurately classify leaf images into various disease categories or identify healthy leaves.
